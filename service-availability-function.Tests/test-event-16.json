Queries to existing DNS records are not affected by this issue.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10, 11:28 AM PDT</span>&nbsp;We are investigating increased propagation times of DNS edits to public and private Route 53 hosted zones, and increased failures for Create Hosted Zone, Delete Hosted Zone, Associate Private Hosted Zone and Disassociate Private Hosted Zone API and Console operations. Queries to existing DNS records are not affected by this issue.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10, 12:06 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We continue to investigate increased propagation times of DNS edits to public and private Route 53 hosted zones, and increased failures for Create Hosted Zone, Delete Hosted Zone, Associate Private Hosted Zone and Disassociate Private Hosted Zone API and Console operations. Queries to existing DNS records are not affected by this issue.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10, 12:35 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have identified the root cause and continue to work toward recovery. This may also impact provisioning workflows for other AWS services that use Route 53 for their DNS names. Queries to existing DNS records are not affected by this issue.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10,  2:01 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;DNS updates are being accepted by the Route 53 API and Console, however an error is preventing the updates from being propagated from the Route53 API system to the live DNS servers. We have identified the root cause of this propagation error and are actively working towards resolution. This issue is impacting provisioning workflows for other AWS services that use Route 53 for their DNS names. Queries to DNS records present at the beginning of this issue are not affected and are being answered normally.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10,  4:00 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;Some DNS changes are now propagating to the live DNS servers.  We continue to work towards full recovery.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10,  5:18 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We are observing steady recovery, with the oldest changes propagating first. We are continuing to work through the backlog of queued changes.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10,  6:30 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;The backlog of queued changes continues to propagate. We have taken steps to accelerate recovery.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10,  7:35 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have now propagated more than half of the backlog of queued changes and are continuing to work on the remainder.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10,  8:23 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have processed the majority of the backlog of queued changes for Route 53 Public DNS. Private DNS changes are still experiencing propagation delays. Until we have fully recovered, customers may receive an error for the following APIs: CreateHostedZone, DeleteHostedZone, AssociateVPCWithHostedZone, and DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone. We continue to work towards full recovery.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10, 10:08 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;As of 8:34 PM PDT, we have resolved the issue resulting in Route 53 Public DNS propagation delays. At this time, Route 53 Private DNS changes are still experiencing propagation delays. Until we have fully recovered, customers will continue to receive errors for the following APIs: CreateHostedZone, DeleteHostedZone, AssociateVPCWithHostedZone, and DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">May 10, 11:51 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We continue to make progress towards restoring propagation for Route 53 Private DNS changes and resolving increased API errors for CreateHostedZone, DeleteHostedZone, AssociateVPCWithHostedZone, and DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone Route 53 API calls. A majority of our hosts have processed all updates, and we are working to accelerate recovery of the remaining hosts.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 1:41 AM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have restored propagation for Route 53 Private DNS changes. We continue to work on resolving increased API errors for CreateHostedZone, DeleteHostedZone, AssociateVPCWithHostedZone, and DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone Route 53 API calls.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 2:39 AM PDT</span>&nbsp;Between May 10 10:50 AM and May 11 2:18 AM PDT we experienced increased change propagation latency and elevated error rates for CreateHostedZone, DeleteHostedZone, AssociateVPCWithHostedZone and DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone calls to the Route 53 API. During this entire duration there were no issues serving DNS queries. The issue has been resolved and the service is now operating normally.</div>",
