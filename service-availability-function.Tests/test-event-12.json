This issue does not affect traffic on running load balancers.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 5:09 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We continue to investigate increased error rates and latencies for ELB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. Traffic remains unaffected on running load balancers. In many cases, a retry of the request may succeed as some requests are still succeeding. Other AWS services that utilize these affected APIs for their own workflows may also be experiencing impact. These services have posted impact to your account events. We’ll continue to update this post as we have more information to share.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 5:35 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have identified the root cause of the increased error rates and latencies for ELB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region and have taken steps to mitigate the issue. We are now seeing recovery for the affected ELB APIs. For the duration of the event, API error rates have remained at a level where retries are likely to succeed. Traffic to existing load balancers was not affected by this event. We will continue to monitor until we can confirm full recovery.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 5:39 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;Between 3:58 PM and 5:28 PM PDT, we experienced increased error rates and latencies for some ELB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. For the duration of the event, API error rates have remained at a level where retries are likely to succeed. Traffic to existing load balancers was not affected by this event. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.</div>",
