This resulted in impaired EC2 instances and degraded EBS volume performance for resources in the affected area of the Availability Zone. The overheating was caused by a control system failure that caused multiple, redundant cooling systems to fail in parts of the affected Availability Zone. The chillers were restored at 11:21 PM PDT and temperatures in the affected areas began to return to normal. As temperatures returned to normal, power was restored to the affected instances. By 2:30 AM PDT, the vast majority of instances and volumes had recovered. We have been working to recover the remaining instances and volumes. A small number of remaining instances and volumes are hosted on hardware which was adversely affected by the loss of power. We continue to work to recover all affected instances and volumes. For immediate recovery, we recommend replacing any remaining affected instances or volumes if possible. Some of the affected instances may require action from customers and we will be reaching out to those customers with next steps.<br><br>Additional details are available <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/message/56489/\">here</a>.

At 4:33 AM PDT one of 10 datacenters in one of the 6 Availability Zones in the US-EAST-1 Region saw a failure of utility power. Backup generators came online immediately, but for reasons we are still investigating, began quickly failing at around 6:00 AM PDT. This resulted in 7.5% of all instances in that Availability Zone failing by 6:10 AM PDT. Over the last few hours we have recovered most instances but still have 1.5% of the instances in that Availability Zone remaining to be recovered. Similar impact existed to EBS and we continue to recover volumes within EBS. New instance launches in this zone continue to work without issue.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 1:30 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;At 4:33 AM PDT one of ten data centers in one of the six Availability Zones in the US-EAST-1 Region saw a failure of utility power. Our backup generators came online immediately but began failing at around 6:00 AM PDT. This impacted 7.5% of EC2 instances and EBS volumes in the Availability Zone. Power was fully restored to the impacted data center at 7:45 AM PDT. By 10:45 AM PDT, all but 1% of instances had been recovered, and by 12:30 PM PDT only 0.5% of instances remained impaired. Since the beginning of the impact, we have been working to recover the remaining instances and volumes. A small number of remaining instances and volumes are hosted on hardware which was adversely affected by the loss of power. We continue to work to recover all affected instances and volumes and will be communicating to the remaining impacted customers via the Personal Health Dashboard. For immediate recovery, we recommend replacing any remaining affected instances or volumes if possible. </div>",

Due to the way that DNS queries are processed, this attack was first experienced by many other DNS server operators as the queries made their way through DNS resolvers on the internet to Route 53. The attack targeted specific DNS names and paths, notably those used to access the global names for S3 buckets.\n\nBecause this attack was widely distributed, a small number of ISPs operating affected DNS resolvers implemented mitigation strategies of their own in an attempt to control the traffic. This is causing DNS lookups through these resolvers for a small number of AWS names to fail. We are doing our best to identify and contact these operators, as quickly as possible, and working with them to enhance their mitigations so that they do not cause impact to valid requests. If you are experiencing issues, please contact us so we can work with your operator to help resolve.</div>",

We have confirmed the root cause, and are working on multiple paths toward recovering the subsytem that is impaired, which is responsible for networking related API calls. This issue mainly affects EC2 RunInstance, and VPC related API requests. Customers using the EC2 Management Console may experience errors Describing Resources, as well as making mutating API requests. Connectivity to existing instances in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 remains unaffected.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 8:49 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We wanted to provide you with more details on the issue causing increased API error rates and latencies in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region. A data store used by a subsystem responsible for the configuration of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks is currently offline and the engineering team are working to restore it. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. In order to do this restore, we needed to disable writes. Error rates and latencies for the networking-related APIs will continue until the restore has been completed and writes re-enabled. We are working through the recovery process now. With issues like this, it is always difficult to provide an accurate ETA, but we expect to complete the restore process within the next 2 hours and begin to allow API requests to proceed once again. We will continue to keep you updated if that ETA changes. Connectivity to existing instances is not impacted. Also, launch requests that refer to regional objects like subnets that already exist will succeed at this stage, as they do not depend on the affected subsystem. If you know the subnet ID, you can use that to launch instances within the region. We apologize for the impact and continue to work towards full resolution. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">10:10 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to make steady progress towards the restoration of the affected data store and are currently within the 2 hours ETA published above.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">10:55 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have completed the restoration of the affected data store but are still working towards re-enabling writes. We have seen an improvement in successful launches over the last 20 minutes and expect that to continue as we work towards full recovery. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">11:45 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We can confirm that all error rates and latencies have returned to normal levels. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">Jan 23, 12:30 AM PST</span>&nbsp;Now that we are fully recovered, we wanted to provide a brief summary of the issue. Starting at 4:07 PM PST, customers began to experience increased error rates and latencies for the network-related APIs in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region. Launches of new EC2 instances also experienced increased failure rates as a result of this issue. Connectivity to existing instances was not affected by this event. We immediately began investigating the root cause and identified that the data store used by the subsystem responsible for the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) regional state was impaired. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. We began the data store restoration process, which took a few hours and by 10:50 PM PST, we had fully restored the primary node in the affected data store. At this stage, we began to see recovery in instance launches within the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region, restoring many customer applications and services to a healthy state. We continued to bring the data store back to a fully operational state and by 11:20 PM PST, all API error rates and latencies had fully recovered. Other AWS services - including AppStream, Elastic Load Balancing, ElastiCache, Relational Database Service, Amazon WorkSpaces and Lambda – were also affected by this event. We apologize for any inconvenience this event may have caused as we know how critical our services are to our customers. We are never satisfied with operational performance of our services that is anything less than perfect, and will do everything we can to learn from this event and drive improvement across our services.</div>",

The issue is affecting the subsystem responsible for updating VPC network configuration and mappings when new instances are launched or Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) are attached to instances, within the affected Availability Zone. This subsystem makes use of a cell-based architecture, which subdivides the Availability Zone into smaller cells, with each cell being responsible for the VPC network configuration and mappings for a subset of instances within the Availability Zone.\n\nAt 9:37 PM PDT on October 8th, a single cell within this subsystem began experiencing elevated failures in updating VPC network configuration and mappings for instances managed by the affected cell. These elevated failures cause network configuration and mappings to be delayed or to fail for new instance launches and attachments of ENIs within the affected cell. The issue can also cause connectivity issues between an affected instance in the affected Availability Zone and newly launched instances within other Availability Zones in the US-EAST-1 Region, since updated VPC network configuration and mappings are not able to be updated within the affected Availability Zone.\n\nWe have identified the root cause and have been working to resolve the issue and restore the updating of VPC network configuration and mappings within the affected cell. For instances that are affected by this issue, relaunching the instance within the affected Availability Zone may mitigate the issue. If possible, relaunching the instance in other Availability Zones will mitigate the issue.\n\nWe will continue to provide updates as we work towards full resolution.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">11:11 AM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have taken steps to address the issue affecting network connectivity for some instances in a single Availability Zone (use1-az2) in the US-EAST-1 Region. As of 10:20 AM PDT, we started to see recovery for affected instances and continue to work toward full resolution of the issue.\n</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">11:54 AM PDT</span>&nbsp;Starting at 9:37 PM PDT on October 8th, we experienced increased network connectivity issues for a subset of instances within a single Availability Zone (use1-az2) in the US-EAST-1 Region. This was caused by a single cell within the subsystem responsible for the updating VPC network configuration and mappings experiencing elevated failures. These elevated failures caused network configuration and mappings to be delayed or to fail for new instance launches and attachments of ENIs within the affected cell. The issue has also caused connectivity issues between an affected instance in the affected Availability Zone(use1-az2) and newly launched instances within other Availability Zones in the US-EAST-1 Region, since updated VPC network configuration and mappings were not able to be updated within the affected Availability Zone(use1-az2). The root cause of the issue was addressed and at 10:20 AM PDT on October 9th, we began to see recovery for the affected instances. By 11:10 AM PDT, all affected instances had fully recovered.

Some Network Load Balancers in USE1-AZ2, USE1-AZ4, and USE1-AZ5 are experiencing connection issues for TLS (SSL) requests. Non-TLS (SSL) requests are not affected by this issue. We are also experiencing some delays in the provisioning of new Network Load Balancers and registration of new targets behind existing Network Load Balancers. We have identified the underlying subsystems responsible for this issue and continue to work towards root cause and resolution.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 1:12 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have identified root cause and are now working to test a fix for the issue affecting connectivity for Networking Load Balancers in the US-EAST-1 Region. Once we have confirmed that it resolves the issue, we will update all affected Network Load Balancers. The issue continues to affect TLS (SSL) connections for Network Load Balancers within the USE1-AZ2, USE1-AZ4, and USE1-AZ5 Availability Zones. The issue does not affect other Availability Zones in the Region and is not expected to affect any additional Network Load Balancers that are currently operating normally. Affected customers can create new Network Load Balancers (with or without TLS) in Availability Zones that are not affected by this issue for immediate mitigation.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 1:37 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have confirmed that the fix to resolve the issue is working as expected and are currently deploying it to the affected Network Load Balancers. We will be deploying one Availability Zone at a time, in the following order: USE1-AZ4, USE1-AZ2, and USE1-AZ5. We expect to see recovery as we progress through the affected Availability Zones.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 2:03 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have made steady progress and are close to completing the rollout of the fix in the USE1-AZ4 Availability Zone. Most of the affected Networking Load Balancers in that Availability Zone are now operating normally. We’ll continue at this pace through the remaining Network Load Balancers in USE1-AZ4, followed by the Network Load Balancers in USE1-AZ2 and USE1-AZ5 Availability Zones. Some customers have reported impact for PrivateLink endpoints, which is related to this issue and will see recovery as we continue to deploy the fix.\n</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 2:43 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to make progress in deploying the fix to Network Load Balancers in the USE1-AZ4 Availability Zone. While the vast majority of the affected Network Load Balancers in that Availability Zone have now recovered, we are making slower progress than expected on the final cell within the Availability Zone. We are working to resolve that issue before moving onto the remaining Availability Zones. We’ll continue to keep you updated on our progress.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 3:27 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have resolved the issue that affected our deployment of the fix to the final cell in the USE1-AZ4 Availability Zone, and continue to deploy to Availability Zones USE1-AZ2 and USE1-AZ5. We have taken steps to accelerate recovery but are also being cautious to not apply the fix to more than one Availability Zone at a time out of an abundance of caution. For customers that have seen their Network Load Balancer recover, we do not expect any further impact. For customers that are still waiting for recovery, we expect to see that in the coming hour or two as we work through the remaining Availability Zone. For immediate mitigation, customers can create a new Network Load Balancer in the unaffected Availability Zones and register the existing back-end targets with it. We’ll continue to provide updates as we progress through the remaining Availability Zones.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 4:03 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to make progress and are now seeing recovery for affected Network Load Balancers in the USE1-AZ2 Availability Zone. We will continue on the remainder of that Availability Zone before completing USE1-AZ5, the final Availability Zone. Again, for Network Load Balancers that have recovered, we do not expect further impact.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 4:28 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have completed applying the fix in both the USE1-AZ4 and USE1-AZ2 Availability Zones. We have started the process of updating the final Availability Zone, USE1-AZ5. We expect to see full recovery within the next 30 minutes. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 4:38 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have completed the update in all affected Availability Zones and all Network Load Balancers are now operating normally. We are working through a backlog of Network Load Balancer created and back-end instance registrations, but at this stage all operations should be operating normally. We will continue to monitor recovery and post an update shortly. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 5:07 PM PST</span>&nbsp;Starting at 11:24 AM PST, some load balancers in the USE1-AZ2, USE1-AZ4, and USE1-AZ5 Availability Zones experienced connectivity issues when terminating TLS (SSL) connections in the US-EAST-1 Region. Engineers worked to identify the root cause of the event, ultimately deploying an update to recover USE1-AZ4 at 1:50 PM PST, USE1-AZ2 at 4:26 PM PST and USE1-AZ5 at 4:31 PM PST. Network Load Balancers not terminating TLS (SSL) connections were not affected by this event. Some PrivateLink endpoints were also affected by the issue. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally. </div>",
